🔗 **Link to Overview**

See [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md) for the full project vision, architecture, and long-term goals.
This document focuses only on Phase 6.

---

## 🎯 Project Context

This DEX auto-trading bot project aims to compete with commercial sniping services like Unibot and Maestro by providing superior intelligence and risk management alongside competitive execution speed. The system uses a dual-lane architecture: Fast Lane for speed-critical opportunities and Smart Lane for comprehensive analysis.

Phase 6 represents the critical transition from an analysis platform to a functional trading bot. All foundation work is complete - we have live blockchain data, SIWE authentication, professional UI, comprehensive token analysis, and MEV protection frameworks. Now we need to implement actual trade execution to fulfill the core promise of automated DEX trading.

**Dependencies from earlier phases:**
- Phase 1-5: Foundation, dashboard, mempool integration, Fast/Smart lane frameworks ✅ COMPLETE
- Live blockchain data integration ✅ OPERATIONAL
- SIWE wallet authentication ✅ OPERATIONAL
- Professional configuration interfaces ✅ OPERATIONAL

## ❓ Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Transaction Execution Priorities
- Should transaction monitoring use WebSocket connections or polling for status updates?
- What's the optimal retry strategy for failed transactions (gas price increases vs. complete retry)?
- How should we handle MEV protection during transaction submission?

### DEX Integration Strategy  
- Should we enhance the existing DEX router service or create a new transaction manager?
- What's the priority order for additional DEX integrations (PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, etc.)?
- Do we need flash loan integration for arbitrage opportunities?

### Portfolio Management Scope
- Should portfolio tracking include LP positions and staking rewards?
- How detailed should historical P&L tracking be (trade-level vs. daily aggregates)?
- Do we need multi-wallet support for institutional users?

### Gas Optimization Integration ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Should we implement EIP-1559 priority fee optimization or stick to legacy gas pricing?~~ **COMPLETE: EIP-1559 implemented**
- ~~Do we need integration with gas price prediction services (Blocknative, etc.)?~~ **COMPLETE: Using engine integration**
- Should we implement transaction replacement (speed up/cancel) functionality?

### Risk Management Integration
- How should trading execution integrate with the existing risk assessment pipeline?
- Should risk checks block trades completely or just warn users?
- Do we need real-time portfolio risk monitoring during trades?

### Performance vs. Safety Trade-offs
- What's the acceptable latency increase for additional safety checks?
- Should we prioritize execution speed or comprehensive error handling?
- How do we balance gas optimization vs. execution speed? ✅ OPTIMIZED: 1-3ms gas optimization overhead
