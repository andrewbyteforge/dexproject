## **JavaScript Files**

### **paper_trading_configuration.js**
Client-side logic for the configuration page handling form interactions, risk calculations, and bot control operations. Implements real-time risk assessment, form synchronization between visual and dropdown selectors, and asynchronous API calls for bot start/stop operations.

**Key Functions:**

**Form Synchronization:**
- Event listeners sync visual mode selector (radio buttons) with dropdown select element
- Bidirectional updates ensure UI consistency
- Triggers risk indicator updates on any change

**Risk Calculation (`updateRiskIndicator()`):**
- Calculates composite risk score (0-100) based on trading mode, position size, stop loss, and confidence threshold
- Score thresholds: <30 = Low, 30-60 = Medium, >60 = High
- Updates risk icon, color, level text, and description dynamically
- Uses Bootstrap icon classes (bi-shield-check, bi-shield-exclamation, bi-shield-x)

**Bot Control Functions:**
- `startBot()`: Sends POST request to `/paper-trading/api/bot/start/` with CSRF token, shows confirmation dialog, displays success/error toast, reloads page after 1.5s
- `stopBot()`: Sends POST request to `/paper-trading/api/bot/stop/` with same pattern as startBot
- Both functions use async/await with proper error handling and try-catch blocks

**Form Management:**
- `saveAsNew()`: Clones current config by adding " (Copy)" suffix and hidden form field
- `resetForm()`: Resets all form fields to default values (MODERATE mode, 25% position size, 20 daily trades, 60% confidence, 5% stop loss, 10% take profit)
- `updateRangeValue()`: Syncs range slider with numeric input field

**Initialization:**
- DOMContentLoaded event listener initializes risk indicator on page load
- Attaches change/input listeners to all form controls for live risk updates

**API Endpoints Used:**
- `POST /paper-trading/api/bot/start/`
- `POST /paper-trading/api/bot/stop/`

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `getCSRFToken()` from base.html
- Requires `showToast()` from base.html
- Uses Bootstrap 5 for styling

### **paper_trading_trade_history.js**
Client-side functionality for the trade history page implementing CSV export, print functionality, and filter management. Handles trade data extraction from the DOM, CSV formatting with proper escaping, and file download generation.

**Key Functions:**

**Data Export (`exportToCSV()`):**
- Scrapes trade data from DOM table rows with `.trade-row` class
- Constructs CSV with 12 columns: Date, Time, Type, Token In, Token Out, Amount In, Amount In USD, Amount Out, Gas Cost USD, Slippage %, Status, Execution Time
- Implements proper CSV escaping for fields containing commas or quotes
- Handles special characters (converts → arrow to -> for CSV compatibility)
- Generates timestamped filename: `paper_trades_YYYY-MM-DD.csv`
- Creates Blob with UTF-8 charset and triggers browser download
- Shows success toast notification after export

**Print Functionality (`printReport()`):**
- Simple wrapper calling `window.print()` for browser native print dialog
- Allows users to print or save as PDF

**Filter Management (`clearFilters()`):**
- Redirects to base trade history URL without query parameters
- Resets all active filters (status, trade type, date range)

**Form Auto-Submit (Optional):**
- Includes commented-out code for instant filter updates on select change
- Can be enabled by uncommenting the DOMContentLoaded event listener
- Currently requires manual "Apply Filters" button click

**CSV Data Processing:**
- Trims whitespace and normalizes spacing in cell text
- Handles multi-line content by consolidating to single line
- Escapes double quotes by doubling them (CSV standard)
- Wraps fields containing commas or quotes in double quotes

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `showToast()` from base.html for success notifications
- Uses browser Blob API and URL.createObjectURL for file downloads
- DOM manipulation relies on specific table structure and CSS classes

**API Endpoints Used:**
- None (all data processing is client-side)
- Filter form submits via standard GET request with query parameters

## **Integration Notes**

### **File Dependencies:**
1. All templates extend `base.html` and inherit its CSS/JS utilities
2. Configuration page requires `paper_trading_configuration.css` and `paper_trading_configuration.js`
3. Trade history page requires `paper_trading_trade_history.js`
4. All pages assume Django static files are properly configured
5. Chart.js 4.4.0 is loaded in base.html for use across analytics and portfolio pages

### **Common Patterns:**
- All forms use Django CSRF tokens via `getCSRFToken()` utility
- Toast notifications use shared `showToast()` function from base.html
- Currency formatting uses `formatCurrency()` from base.html
- All API calls use async/await with try-catch error handling
- Confirmation dialogs precede destructive operations (start/stop bot, reset form)

### **Static File Locations:**
```
dexproject/static/
├── css/
│   ├── home.css (loaded in base.html)
│   ├── analytics.css (loaded in base.html)
│   └── paper_trading_configuration.css
