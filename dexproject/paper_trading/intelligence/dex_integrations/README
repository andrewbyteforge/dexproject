### `base_dex.py`
**Purpose:** Abstract base class that all DEX integrations must inherit from

**What it does:**
- Defines the common interface that all DEX implementations must follow
- Provides shared infrastructure for Web3, caching, error handling, and performance tracking
- Implements circuit breaker pattern to disable failing DEXs temporarily

**Key Components:**

#### `DEXPrice` Data Class
Represents a price quote from a specific DEX with the following fields:
- `dex_name` - Name of the DEX
- `token_address` - Token contract address
- `token_symbol` - Token symbol
- `price_usd` - Price in USD (Optional)
- `liquidity_usd` - Available liquidity in USD (Optional)
- `timestamp` - When quote was obtained
- `success` - Whether query succeeded
- `error_message` - Error message if failed
- `response_time_ms` - Query response time

#### `BaseDEX` Abstract Class
**Abstract methods (must be implemented by subclasses):**
- `get_token_price()` - Fetch current token price
- `get_liquidity()` - Query available liquidity
- `is_available()` - Check if DEX is operational

**Infrastructure provided:**
- **Web3 Client Management:** Lazy initialization of Web3 connections
- **Caching:** Built-in price caching with configurable TTL (default 30 seconds)
- **Circuit Breaker:** Automatically disables DEX after 5 consecutive failures for 5 minutes
- **Performance Tracking:** Tracks total queries, success/failure rates, response times
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error handling and logging patterns

**Key Methods:**
- `_ensure_web3_client()` - Lazy initialization of Web3 client
- `_get_cache_key()` - Generate cache keys
- `_get_cached_price()` / `_cache_price()` - Cache management
- `_record_success()` / `_record_failure()` - Circuit breaker tracking
- `get_performance_stats()` - Return performance metrics
- `cleanup()` - Resource cleanup

### `uniswap_v3.py`
**Purpose:** Uniswap V3 DEX integration for real price queries

**What it does:**
- Queries real Uniswap V3 pools on-chain
- Searches across all fee tiers (0.05%, 0.3%, 1%) to find best liquidity
- Calculates prices from actual pool token balances (using `balanceOf`)
- Returns both price and liquidity data

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-fee-tier search:** Checks all three Uniswap V3 fee tiers
- **Best pool selection:** Chooses pool with highest liquidity
- **Base token pairing:** Finds pairs with WETH or USDC
- **Accurate pricing:** Uses actual token balances, not sqrt price formulas
- **Includes ERC20 ABI:** Minimal ABI for `balanceOf` and `decimals` queries

**Configuration:**
- Factory addresses for Base Sepolia (84532), Base Mainnet (8453), Ethereum (1)
- Base tokens: WETH and USDC addresses per chain
- Fee tiers from `DEXComparisonDefaults.UNISWAP_V3_FEE_TIERS`

**Key Methods:**
- `get_token_price()` - Main method to get price from Uniswap V3
- `_find_best_pool()` - Search all fee tiers and base tokens for best pool
- `_query_pool_data()` - Query specific pool for reserves, price, and liquidity
- `_get_base_tokens()` - Get WETH/USDC addresses for the chain

**Price Calculation (FIXED):**
1. Queries pool's `token0()` and `token1()` to identify which tokens are in the pool
2. Creates ERC20 contracts for both tokens
3. Uses `balanceOf(pool_address)` to get actual token amounts held by the pool
4. Gets `decimals()` for both tokens to properly normalize raw balances
5. Normalizes raw balances: `amount = raw_balance / (10 ** decimals)`
6. Calculates price ratio from actual amounts: `price = base_amount / token_amount`
7. Converts to USD using base token (USDC = $1, WETH = ~$2500)
8. Calculates liquidity: `liquidity_usd = base_amount * base_price * 2`

**Why This Fix Matters:**
- ❌ OLD METHOD: Used `slot0()` sqrt_price_x96 which required complex math and was error-prone
- ✅ NEW METHOD: Uses actual token balances which is straightforward and accurate
- Prevents returning $0 or billions for prices

---

### `sushiswap.py`
**Purpose:** SushiSwap (V2-style) DEX integration for real price queries

**What it does:**
- Queries real SushiSwap pairs on-chain
- Uses Uniswap V2-style pair contracts
- Calculates prices from token reserves (properly normalized for decimals)
- Returns price and liquidity data

**Key Features:**
- **V2-style pools:** Uses constant product (x*y=k) formula
- **Base token pairing:** Finds pairs with WETH or USDC
- **Best pair selection:** Chooses pair with highest liquidity
- **Decimal-aware pricing:** Normalizes reserves before calculating price
- **Includes ERC20 ABI:** Minimal ABI for `decimals` queries

**Configuration:**
- Factory addresses for Base Sepolia (84532), Base Mainnet (8453), Ethereum (1)
- Base tokens: WETH and USDC addresses per chain
- Includes minimal Factory and Pair ABIs

**Key Methods:**
- `get_token_price()` - Main method to get price from SushiSwap
- `_find_best_pair()` - Search for pairs with WETH/USDC
- `_query_pair_data()` - Query specific pair for reserves and calculate price
- `_get_base_tokens()` - Get WETH/USDC addresses for the chain

**Price Calculation (FIXED):**
1. Queries pair's `getReserves()` for raw token reserves (in wei/smallest units)
2. Queries `token0()` and `token1()` to identify which reserve is which
3. Determines which reserve corresponds to our token vs base token
4. **CRITICAL:** Gets `decimals()` for BOTH tokens before any calculations
5. **Normalizes reserves to actual amounts FIRST:**
   - `token_amount = raw_reserve / (10 ** token_decimals)`
   - `base_amount = raw_reserve / (10 ** base_decimals)`
6. **Only then calculates price:** `price_ratio = base_amount / token_amount`
7. Converts to USD based on base token (USDC = $1, WETH = ~$2500)
8. Calculates liquidity: `liquidity_usd = base_amount * base_price * 2`

**Why This Fix Matters:**
- ❌ OLD METHOD: Calculated price from raw reserves, then divided by decimals (WRONG ORDER)
- ✅ NEW METHOD: Normalizes reserves FIRST, then calculates price (CORRECT ORDER)
- Example: If USDC (6 decimals) and TOKEN (18 decimals) both have reserve of 1,000,000:
  - OLD: `price = 1000000 / 1000000 = 1`, then adjust = totally wrong
  - NEW: `usdc = 1000000/(10^6) = 1`, `token = 1000000/(10^18) = 0.000001`, `price = 1/0.000001 = 1,000,000` ✅

**ABIs Defined:**
- `FACTORY_ABI` - Minimal factory ABI with `getPair()` function
- `PAIR_ABI` - Minimal pair ABI with `getReserves()`, `token0()`, `token1()`
- `ERC20_ABI` - Minimal ERC20 ABI with `decimals()` function

### `curve.py`
**Purpose:** Curve Finance DEX integration optimized for stablecoins

**What it does:**
- Provides fast-path pricing for known stablecoins (returns $1.00 instantly)
- Queries Curve pools for other tokens (when registry available)
- Optimized for stablecoin and similar-asset swaps

**Key Features:**
- **Stablecoin fast path:** Instantly returns $1.00 for USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, LUSD
- **No on-chain query needed:** For stablecoins, no Web3 calls required
- **Limited testnet support:** Primarily works on Ethereum Mainnet (registry available)
- **High assumed liquidity:** Returns $1M liquidity for stablecoins

**Configuration:**
- Curve Registry addresses (currently only Ethereum Mainnet)
- Known stablecoins dictionary: USDC, USDT, DAI, FRAX, LUSD all = $1.00

**Key Methods:**
- `get_token_price()` - Check if stablecoin first, then query pools
- `_is_stablecoin()` - Check if token is a known stablecoin
- `_get_stablecoin_price()` - Return $1.00 for stablecoins

**Behavior:**
- For stablecoins: Returns immediately with $1.00 price (extremely fast)
- For other tokens on mainnet: Would query Curve registry (not fully implemented)
- For other tokens on testnets: Returns unavailable

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### Circuit Breaker Pattern
All DEX integrations inherit circuit breaker protection from `BaseDEX`:
- Tracks consecutive failures
- After 5 consecutive failures, disables DEX for 5 minutes
- Automatically re-enables after cooldown period
- Prevents wasting resources on repeatedly failing DEXs

### Caching Strategy
All price queries are cached with configurable TTL (default 30 seconds):
- Cache key format: `dex:{dex_name}:{chain_id}:price:{token_address}`
- Reduces on-chain queries and improves performance
- Cached `DEXPrice` objects include all metadata

### Performance Tracking
Each DEX instance tracks:
- Total queries made
- Successful vs failed queries
- Success rate percentage
- Average response time
- Consecutive failure count
- Disabled status and cooldown expiry

### Base Token Strategy
Both Uniswap V3 and SushiSwap use base tokens to find pricing pairs:
- First priority: USDC (direct USD pricing)
- Second priority: WETH (needs conversion to USD)
- Searches for pairs with both base tokens
- Selects pair with highest liquidity

---

## 🎯 Usage Priority

When the system queries multiple DEXs:

1. **Uniswap V3** - Primary DEX (most liquidity, accurate pricing)
2. **SushiSwap** - Alternative for tokens not on Uniswap
3. **Curve** - Specialized for stablecoins (instant pricing)

The system can query all DEXs in parallel and select the best price or aggregate results.

## 🔗 Dependencies

**External:**
- `django.utils.timezone` - Timezone-aware timestamps
- `django.core.cache` - Django cache framework

**Internal:**
- `paper_trading.intelligence.analyzers.constants` - Chain configs, ABIs, addresses
- `paper_trading.defaults.DEXComparisonDefaults` - Configuration defaults

**Required Constants:**
- `UNISWAP_V3_FACTORY` - Factory contract addresses per chain
- `FACTORY_ABI` - Uniswap V3 factory ABI
- `POOL_ABI` - Uniswap V3 pool ABI
- `FEE_TIERS` - Uniswap V3 fee tier values
- `ENGINE_CONFIG_MODULE_AVAILABLE` - Flag for Web3 infrastructure
- `Web3Client` - Web3 connection manager

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Centralization Opportunities
Several areas currently have hardcoded values that should be moved to central configuration:

**Token Addresses (duplicated in both uniswap_v3.py and sushiswap.py):**
- WETH addresses per chain
- USDC addresses per chain
- Should be moved to `constants.py` or `defaults.py`

**SushiSwap Factory Addresses:**
- Currently hardcoded in `sushiswap.py`
- Should be moved to `constants.py` similar to Uniswap V3

**Curve Registry Addresses:**
- Currently hardcoded in `curve.py`
- Should be moved to `constants.py`

**Known Stablecoins:**
- Defined in `curve.py`
- Should be moved to `defaults.py` or `constants.py`

**ERC20 ABI:**
- Currently duplicated in both `uniswap_v3.py` and `sushiswap.py`
- Should be defined once in `constants.py` and imported

### Web3 Infrastructure
All DEXs depend on:
- `Web3Client` class being available
- Engine config module initialized
- Chain configurations present
- Without these, DEXs gracefully fail and return error responses

### Error Handling
All methods include comprehensive error handling:
- Try-catch blocks around Web3 calls
- Detailed logging at appropriate levels
- Returns `DEXPrice` with `success=False` on errors
- Never throws unhandled exceptions

### Async/Await
All main methods are async:
- `get_token_price()`
- `get_liquidity()`
- `is_available()`
- Supports parallel execution across multiple DEXs

## 🛠️ Recent Fixes Applied

### Uniswap V3 Fix
**Problem:** Used broken `sqrt_price_x96` calculation that returned $0 or billions
**Solution:** Now uses `balanceOf()` to get actual token reserves and calculates price from real token amounts

### SushiSwap Fix  
**Problem:** Calculated price from raw reserves without normalizing for decimals first
**Solution:** Now gets decimals for both tokens and normalizes reserves BEFORE calculating price ratio

Both fixes ensure accurate price calculations by working with actual token amounts rather than raw blockchain values.
