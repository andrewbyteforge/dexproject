---

## Vision & Competitive Positioning
<!-- Project high-level vision with competitive reality -->
The goal of this project is to develop a **dual-mode DEX auto-trading bot** that competes directly with commercial sniping services while providing superior intelligence and risk management.

**Core Competitive Strategy: Hybrid Approach**
