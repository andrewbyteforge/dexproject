## 🔥 Today's Accomplishments (October 2025)

### Transaction Retry Logic Enhancement - COMPLETED TODAY

#### 1. **Stuck Transaction Monitoring**
```python
# Enhanced monitoring system:
- Smart detection using multiple criteria
- Adaptive thresholds based on gas prices
- Mempool drop detection
- Nonce conflict resolution
```

#### 2. **Intelligent Replacement Logic**
```python
# Cost-benefit analysis for replacements:
- Won't spend >5% of trade value on gas
- Requires minimum 10% gas increase
- Maximum 2 replacement attempts
- Different strategies per stuck reason
```

#### 3. **Nonce Management System**
```python
# Comprehensive nonce handling:
- Gap detection between transactions
- Conflict resolution
- User-grouped transaction ordering
- Expected nonce tracking
```
