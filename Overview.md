   - WebSocket mempool streaming
   - Real-time pending transaction monitoring
   - Event filtering and analysis

2. **Implement MEV Protection** (`engine/mempool/protection.py`)
   - Sandwich attack detection
   - Front-running protection
   - Private relay routing

## **Week 5-6: Integration & Testing**

# 💡 **KEY INSIGHTS FOR SUCCESS**

## **Technical Reality Check**
- **Current execution speed:** ~2-5 seconds (too slow for market)
- **Target execution speed:** <500ms (competitive requirement)
- **Performance gap:** 10-25x improvement needed
- **Solution:** Fast Lane architecture with mempool integration

## **Market Competition Facts**
- **Maestro Bot:** <200ms execution, $X million volume
- **Banana Gun:** <150ms execution, private mempool access
- **Unibot:** <300ms execution, social trading features
- **Our advantage:** Intelligence + competitive speed + transparency

## **Success Dependencies**
1. **Fast Lane implementation** - Without this, project fails
2. **Mempool integration** - Without this, cannot compete
3. **Real-time dashboard** - Without this, poor UX
4. **Smart Lane differentiation** - This is our competitive moat

---

**Bottom Line: We have built an excellent foundation (70% of total work), but we're missing the 30% that determines market success. The Fast Lane execution engine and mempool integration are not optional features - they are market entry requirements. Focus all effort on these two components over the next 6-8 weeks to achieve market viability.**
