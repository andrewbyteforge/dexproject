## üîç Detected Code Duplication & Issues

### 1. Paper Trading vs Real Trading Duplication
**Problem**: Significant overlap between paper trading and real trading logic

**Duplicated Components:**
- Trade execution logic in `paper_trading/services/simulator.py` vs `trading/tasks.py`
- Portfolio tracking in both paper and real trading services
- Transaction state management duplicated
- Gas optimization calculations repeated

**Solution**: Create unified base classes/services that both paper and real modes inherit from

### 2. Service Initialization Pattern Duplication
**Problem**: Multiple services repeat the same initialization pattern

**Found in:**
- `trading/services/dex_router_service.py`
- `trading/services/portfolio_service.py`
- `trading/services/transaction_manager.py`
- `paper_trading/services/simulator.py`

**Solution**: Create a `BaseTraingService` abstract class with common initialization

### 3. WebSocket Update Logic Duplication
**Problem**: WebSocket broadcasting logic repeated across multiple files

**Found in:**
- `paper_trading/signals.py`
- `trading/services/transaction_manager.py`
- Dashboard views

**Solution**: Centralize in `shared/services/websocket_service.py`

### 4. Missing Abstraction Layer
**Problem**: No clear separation between paper and real trading modes

**Impact**: Difficult to switch between modes, duplicate code paths

**Solution**: Implement a Trading Engine abstraction that delegates to appropriate implementation
