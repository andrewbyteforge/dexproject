**What I'm going to do:**
I'll update the overview.md with the comprehensive findings about the paper trading app's actual completion status and what remains to be done.

## Updated Overview.md with Paper Trading Findings

### 📊 Current Architecture - UPDATED

#### ✅ Paper Trading App - 95% COMPLETE (Major Discovery)

- **Comprehensive API layer**: 14 fully functional API endpoints
- **WebSocket infrastructure**: consumers.py and routing.py present
- **Bot implementation**: Enhanced with Intel Slider system and AI engine
- **Template suite**: 7 templates including analytics dashboard
- **Service layer**: Simulator and WebSocket services operational

**Paper Trading Components Verified:**

### 🔍 What's Actually Remaining

#### Paper Trading Specific Gaps (5% remaining)

1. **Bot Process Automation**
   - Celery task integration incomplete (TODO comments in api_start_bot/stop_bot)
   - Bot runs via management command but not automated via API

2. **User Authentication Integration**
   - Currently hardcoded to 'demo_user'
   - Need to switch to request.user for production

3. **Real-time Price Feeds**
   - Position prices are static
   - Need integration with live price services

4. **WebSocket Channel Configuration**
   - Files exist but ASGI configuration not verified
   - Django Channels setup may be incomplete

#### System-Wide Remaining Work

1. **Cross-System Integration**
   - Paper trading isolated from Phase 6B Transaction Manager benefits
   - Missing connection to main risk assessment engine
   - Not using gas optimization from Phase 6A

2. **Production Configuration**
   - No production settings file
   - Missing environment-based configuration
   - No deployment scripts

3. **Transaction Retry Logic**
   - No automatic retry on failure
   - Missing gas escalation strategy
   - No circuit breaker implementation

4. **Advanced Features Not Started**
   - Analytics app is placeholder only
   - ML/AI enhancement phase pending
   - Cross-chain arbitrage not implemented
   - Solana integration not started

### 📋 Corrected Development Priorities

#### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Connect Paper Trading to Transaction Manager**
   ```python
   # In paper_trading/bot/simple_trader.py
   # Import and use transaction_manager for all trades
   from trading.services.transaction_manager import TransactionManager
   ```

2. **Fix Bot Automation**
   ```python
   # Create tasks.py in paper_trading app
   # Implement Celery tasks for bot control
   @shared_task
   def run_paper_trading_bot(session_id):
       # Bot execution logic
   ```

3. **Enable WebSocket Updates**
   ```python
   # Verify ASGI configuration
   # Test WebSocket connections
   # Enable real-time dashboard updates
   ```

#### Phase 1: Integration & Cleanup (Week 2)

1. **Unify Trading Systems**
   - Create base classes for paper/live trading
   - Share transaction manager between modes
   - Implement unified portfolio service

2. **Complete Authentication**
   - Remove demo_user hardcoding
   - Implement proper user context
   - Add multi-account support

3. **Connect Risk Engine**
   - Integrate risk assessment in paper trades
   - Use main risk scoring system
   - Add risk-based trade rejection

#### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Week 3-4)

1. **Retry Logic & Recovery**
   - Implement transaction retry with gas escalation
   - Add exponential backoff
   - Create circuit breakers

2. **Production Configuration**
   - Create production settings
   - Add environment variables
   - Implement secrets management

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add caching layer
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement connection pooling
