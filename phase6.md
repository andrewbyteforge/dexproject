# Phase 6 ‚Äì Trading Execution Implementation

üîó **Link to Overview**

See [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md) for the full project vision, architecture, and long-term goals.
This document focuses only on Phase 6.

---

## üéØ Project Context

This DEX auto-trading bot project aims to compete with commercial sniping services like Unibot and Maestro by providing superior intelligence and risk management alongside competitive execution speed. The system uses a dual-lane architecture: Fast Lane for speed-critical opportunities and Smart Lane for comprehensive analysis.

Phase 6 represents the critical transition from an analysis platform to a functional trading bot. All foundation work is complete - we have live blockchain data, SIWE authentication, professional UI, comprehensive token analysis, and MEV protection frameworks. Now we need to implement actual trade execution to fulfill the core promise of automated DEX trading.

**Dependencies from earlier phases:**
- Phase 1-5: Foundation, dashboard, mempool integration, Fast/Smart lane frameworks ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Live blockchain data integration ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- SIWE wallet authentication ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
- Professional configuration interfaces ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL

## ‚ùì Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Trading Implementation Priorities
- Should we implement Uniswap V2 or V3 first, or both simultaneously?
- What's the priority order for additional DEX integrations (PancakeSwap, SushiSwap, etc.)?
- Do we need flash loan integration for arbitrage opportunities?

### Portfolio Management Scope
- Should portfolio tracking include LP positions and staking rewards?
- How detailed should historical P&L tracking be (trade-level vs. daily aggregates)?
- Do we need multi-wallet support for institutional users?

### Gas Optimization Strategy
- Should we implement EIP-1559 priority fee optimization or stick to legacy gas pricing?
- Do we need integration with gas price prediction services (Blocknative, etc.)?
- Should we implement transaction replacement (speed up/cancel) functionality?

### Risk Management Integration
- How should trading execution integrate with the existing risk assessment pipeline?
- Should risk checks block trades completely or just warn users?
- Do we need real-time portfolio risk monitoring during trades?

### Performance vs. Safety Trade-offs
- What's the acceptable latency increase for additional safety checks?
- Should we prioritize execution speed or comprehensive error handling?
- How do we balance gas optimization vs. execution speed?
