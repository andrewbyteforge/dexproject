## üéØ Project Context

The DEX auto-trading bot is now fully operational in production with proven trading execution, scalable infrastructure, and enterprise-grade reliability. Phase 8 focuses on advanced features that differentiate us from competitors and capture institutional customers who require sophisticated tools, compliance features, and integration capabilities.

This phase targets the premium market segment: professional trading firms, institutions, and advanced users who need more than basic buy/sell functionality. We're building features that commercial bots like Unibot and Maestro don't offer, establishing our competitive moat in the intelligence and professional tools space.

**Dependencies from earlier phases:**
- Phase 1-7: Complete production-ready trading platform ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- Proven track record of successful trades and user satisfaction ‚úÖ REQUIRED
- Stable infrastructure handling significant user load ‚úÖ REQUIRED

## ‚ùì Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Portfolio Management Scope
- Should we support traditional assets (stocks, bonds) alongside crypto?
- How deep should cross-chain integration go (all L1s and L2s vs. major chains only)?
- Do we need integration with CeFi platforms (Coinbase, Binance) for complete portfolio view?

### API Strategy and Monetization
- Should the API be free for basic usage with premium tiers?
- What rate limits are appropriate for different user types?
- Should we allow third-party developers to build on our platform?

### Institutional Features Priority
- Which compliance standards are most important for target customers?
- Should we build custom solutions or integrate with existing compliance tools?
- How important is on-premise deployment vs. cloud-only?

### AI/ML Implementation
- Should we build ML models in-house or integrate with external services?
- How do we handle data privacy for ML training?
- What's the balance between AI automation and user control?

### Competitive Positioning
- Should we focus on features that directly compete with TradingView/institutional platforms?
- How do we price premium features to remain competitive with enterprise solutions?
- Should we target acquisition by larger players or remain independent?
