# Phase 7 – Production Deployment & Scaling

🔗 **Link to Overview**

See [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md) for the full project vision, architecture, and long-term goals.
This document focuses only on Phase 7.

---

## 🎯 Project Context

The DEX auto-trading bot has achieved full trading capability through Phase 6, with users able to execute real trades using both Fast Lane (speed-focused) and Smart Lane (intelligence-focused) approaches. The system now needs production-grade deployment infrastructure to handle real users, significant trading volumes, and enterprise-level reliability requirements.

This phase transforms the project from a working prototype to a scalable trading platform that can compete with commercial services like Unibot and Maestro. Focus areas include performance optimization, infrastructure scaling, monitoring, and security hardening.

**Dependencies from earlier phases:**
- Phase 1-6: Complete trading functionality ✅ REQUIRED
- Real DEX trading execution ✅ REQUIRED
- Portfolio management system ✅ REQUIRED
- Gas optimization and MEV protection ✅ REQUIRED

## ❓ Open Questions / Decisions Needed

### Infrastructure Architecture
- Should we use managed Kubernetes (GKE/EKS) or self-hosted cluster?
- What's the optimal database configuration for high-frequency trading data?
- Do we need multi-region deployment for global users?

### Performance Scaling Strategy
- Should we implement horizontal scaling for trading engines or vertical scaling?
- What's the optimal caching strategy for real-time blockchain data?
- Do we need dedicated WebSocket servers or can we use the main application servers?

### Security and Compliance
- What security certifications do we need for institutional adoption (SOC 2, ISO 27001)?
- Should we implement IP whitelisting for high-value accounts?
- How do we handle GDPR and other privacy regulations?

### Monitoring and Observability
- What SLA targets should we commit to for trading execution?
- How detailed should our performance metrics be (per-user vs. aggregate)?
- Should we implement custom metrics for trading-specific KPIs?

### Deployment Strategy
- Should we use blue-green or rolling deployments for zero downtime?
- How do we handle database migrations in production?
- What's the rollback strategy if a deployment causes trading issues?
