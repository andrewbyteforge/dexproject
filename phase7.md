# Phase 7 ‚Äì Local Production Deployment (Single User)

üîó **Link to Overview**

See [OVERVIEW.md](./OVERVIEW.md) for the full project vision, architecture, and long-term goals.
This document focuses only on Phase 7 adapted for local single-user deployment.

---

## üéØ Project Context

The DEX auto-trading bot has achieved full trading capability through Phase 6, with users able to execute real trades using both Fast Lane (speed-focused) and Smart Lane (intelligence-focused) approaches. For Phase 7, we're focusing on creating a production-grade deployment on a local machine for a single user (yourself), establishing stability, monitoring, and security without the complexity of cloud infrastructure.

This approach allows for a robust personal trading system with professional-grade monitoring and performance optimization, which can later be scaled to multi-user cloud deployment if desired.

**Dependencies from earlier phases:**
- Phase 1-6: Complete trading functionality ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Real DEX trading execution ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Portfolio management system ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Gas optimization and MEV protection ‚úÖ COMPLETE

[ ] **Database Optimization & Backup**
- PostgreSQL performance tuning for trading workloads
- Automated daily backups to external location
- Database maintenance scripts (VACUUM, ANALYZE, REINDEX)
- Transaction history archiving for performance

[ ] **Local Monitoring & Alerting**
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics visualization

- System resource monitoring (CPU, RAM, disk, network)
- Email/Discord notifications for critical events
- Trade execution performance tracking

[ ] **Performance Optimization**
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data

[ ] **Security Hardening (Local)**
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data (private keys, API keys)
- Environment variable management for credentials
- Local firewall configuration
- API rate limiting (even for local access)
- Comprehensive audit logging for all trades
- Secure backup encryption

[ ] **Local Deployment Automation**
- Deployment scripts for updates

## ‚ùì Adjusted Questions for Local Deployment

### System Resources
- What are your system specifications (RAM, CPU, SSD)?
- How much disk space is available for database and logs?
- Do you have an external drive or NAS for backups?

### Monitoring Preferences
- Do you prefer Discord, email, or desktop notifications?
- What metrics are most important to track?
- How often should health checks run?

### Performance Requirements
- How many simultaneous trading strategies will run?
- What's your typical trading frequency?
- How much historical data needs quick access?

### Security Considerations
- Where will you store encrypted backups?
- Do you need remote access to the system?
- Should the system auto-stop trading on anomalies?
